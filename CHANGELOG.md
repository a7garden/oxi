# Changelog

All notable changes to the oxi project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added — oxi-agent

- **2-level agentic loop** matching pi-mono architecture: outer loop (follow-up messages), inner loop (tool calls + steering)
- **turn_start / turn_end events** emitted each iteration for lifecycle tracking
- **Steering messages**: inject user messages mid-run via `session.steer()`, polled after each turn
- **Follow-up messages**: queue messages during agent execution, processed when agent would stop via `session.follow_up()`
- **beforeToolCall / afterToolCall hooks** for tool execution pipeline customization
- **shouldStopAfterTurn hook** for graceful early termination
- **ToolExecutionMode** (Sequential / Parallel) config on AgentHooks
- **Terminate flag propagation**: batch terminates only when every tool result sets `terminate: true`
- **Streaming message lifecycle events**: `MessageStart` → `MessageUpdate` (per delta) → `MessageEnd`
- **ThinkingDelta forwarding** to TUI for real-time reasoning display
- **AgentHooks** struct with all hook types (get_steering_messages, get_follow_up_messages, etc.)
- **ToolBatchResult** for batch tool execution results
- **Compaction per iteration**: context window check at each iteration, not just once

### Added — oxi-cli

- **Tool snippets in system prompt**: Available tools now show descriptions instead of "(none)"
- **AgentSession queue → Agent hooks connection**: steering/follow-up queues wired to agent loop
- **Input unlock during agent busy**: typing, paste, and Enter allowed while agent is streaming
- **Enter while busy → queue as steering message** instead of being ignored

### Fixed

- **TurnEnd event**: real assistant message instead of placeholder UserMessage
- **Fallback model logic restored** on stream error
- **turn_number**: incremented before use (was starting at 0)
- **web_search.rs** compilation error simplified
- **Removed dead code**: old `execute_tool()` method, unused imports, Korean comments → English
- **ToolExecutionMode default**: Sequential (parallel was fallback to sequential anyway)

### Changed

- System prompt tool descriptions now populated from `tool_snippets` HashMap
- Agent loop restructured from single loop to pi-mono 2-level loop architecture

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed — oxi-ai

- **TextDelta double-push bug** in `high_level.rs` `complete()` function. Text was being pushed to `text_buffer` twice at block boundaries, causing double-counting. Fixed by reordering logic to execute `text_buffer.push_str(&delta)` exactly once.
- **ToolCallStart synthetic ID generation** now uses the actual `tool_call_id` from provider events instead of always generating synthetic IDs.

- **SSE parsing edge cases** comprehensively tested for both OpenAI and Anthropic providers. Added 39 unit tests covering single/multiple events, finish reasons, tool call deltas, usage accumulation, thinking blocks, carriage return line endings, and malformed input handling.
- **Serialization roundtrip tests** added to `types.rs`, `messages.rs`, and `error.rs`. All core types now have comprehensive test coverage for JSON/MessagePack roundtrips.
- Fixed pre-existing `concat!` macro syntax errors in `providers/anthropic.rs` and `providers/openai.rs`.


### Changed — oxi-ai

- `ProviderEvent::ToolCallStart` now carries `tool_call_id: Option<String>` for real tool call IDs from providers.

- `ContentBlockStart` (Anthropic) now includes `id` field.
- `ContentBlockRef` (Bedrock) now includes `id` field.

### Added — oxi-agent

- **Parallel tool execution**: `execute_tool_calls_parallel` now uses `futures::future::join_all` for concurrent execution while preserving result order.
- **Circuit breaker integration**: `CircuitBreaker` from `recovery.rs` is now wired into `AgentLoop`. Configurable threshold and open duration with automatic recovery.
- **18 integration tests** covering multi-turn tool use loop, compaction flow, cross-provider model switching, error recovery scenarios, steering messages, and follow-up queue processing.

### Added — oxi-cli

- **48 AgentSession tests** covering model cycling, thinking level changes, steering/follow-up queues, compaction trigger logic, session persistence, and event subscriptions.
